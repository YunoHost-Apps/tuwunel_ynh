Tuwunel is a successor to Conduwuit, a feature fork of Conduit.
It is a lightweight open-source server implementation of the Matrix Specification with a focus on easy setup and low system requirements. That means you can make your own Tuwunel setup in just a few minutes.
Tuwunel keeps things simple, it's a single binary with an embedded database and can be much faster than other server implementations in some cases.
